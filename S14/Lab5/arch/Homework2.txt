1) The 8088 has 8 general purpose registers.

2) The BX register is the full 16-bit general purpose register, but the BX register can be subdivided into two
8-bit registers called the BH (high) and BL (low) if the programmer wants to use smaller representations than 16-bits.

3) a)0000:0000 = 0x00000 + 0x0000 = 0x00000
   b)A000:BCD0 = 0xA0000 + 0xBCD0 = 0xABCD0
   
4)JMP LABEL

5)ADD AX, 1 (AX = AX + 1)

6) (ADD WORD PTR [4000h], 1) is incrementing the value at 0x4000 in a 16-bit interpretation while
(ADD BYTE PTR [4000h], 1) is incrementing the value at 0x4000 in a 8-bit interpretation.

7) Not sure what this question is asking...

8) A global variable would be stored in the the data segment of memory, while a local variable would be stored on the
stack segment.

9) I'm not quite sure, but I would assume it would be easier to keep track of the parameters if they were
pushed onto the stack in an ordered manner.
