1)  0x7F006628 - 4 bytes = 0x7F006629. The SP register contains the stack pointer.

2) The heap is an area of pre-reserved memory that a program process can use to store data in some variable amount.
   The heap is usually used to store objects. The heap is stored in computer RAM just like the stack.
   
3) The 8088 has 8 general purpose registers. These registers are called: AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, and SP.

4) The Pentium's registers are 32-bit registers instead of 16-bits and have different names. 
   They are called: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP, and ESP.
   
5) JMP LABEL

6) objdump -d filename

7) A global variable would be stored in the the data segment of memory, while a local variable would be stored on the
stack segment.

8) The x86 Pentium assembly uses 32-bit registers, has more bus lines, more options, and more instructions than the
8088.

9) It is easier for the stack to keep track of and manipulate the parameters when they are pushed onto the stack
in a left-to-right order.

10)#define in C is how you make a constant variable. It is like final in JAVA.
