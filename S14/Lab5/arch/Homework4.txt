1) Virtual memory is a memory management technique that is implemented using both hardware and software.
   It maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory.
   Virtual memory is useful, because it allows you to use more memory than you physically have.

2) A page table is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the 
   mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses.

3) A page fault (sometimes #pf or pf) is a trap to the software raised by the hardware when a program accesses a 
   page that is mapped in the virtual address space, but not loaded in physical memory.

4) A Pentium can use 16, 32, or 46-48 bits for addressing. How many bits it uses depends on which Pentium you
   are using and that Pentium's register sizes (16, 32, or 64 bits).
