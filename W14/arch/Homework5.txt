1)SIMD means "single instruction, multiple data." So, SIMD describes doing the same operation independently on
several different pieces of data. 

MIMD means "multiple instruction, multiple data." So, MIMD would be like one
pipeline performing a floating point multiplication on a piece of data, while another pipeline could be loading a register
on another piece of data. 

A GPU uses SIMD because SIMD is a fast way of moving large blocks of data fromm main memory to 
the graphics display. SIMD essentially performs the same instruction for graphics on multiple pieces of data at the same
time.

2)Temporal locality is the concept that a resource that is referenced at one point in time will be referenced 
again sometime in the near future.

Spatial locality is the concept that likelihood of referencing a resource is higher if a resource near it 
was just referenced. 

Example: for(i = 0; i < 20; i++)
           for(j = 0; j < 10; j++)
               a[i] = a[i]*j;
               
          In this example a[i] is a good example of spatial locality because a memory location near the one just used
          is being referenced each time through the loop. Example: a[0] is used, then a[1], then a[2] and etc.
          
          In this example a[i] is also a good example of temporal locality because the memory location just referenced
          is being used 10 times through each loop. Example: a[i] = a[i]*0, a[i] = a[i]*1, a[i]= a[i]*2, and etc.
