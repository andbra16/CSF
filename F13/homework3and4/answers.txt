Homework 4 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.

Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.430292666667

Problem 3:

I received an error because the program tried to use the variable "linenum" that was not defined yet because it was commented out by me. linenum = linenum+1 -- the program uses linenum as a variable that updates itself +1 everytime it goes through the loop. Therefore, linenum must be defined before that line in order to operate.

If I commented out gc_count= 0, the program would get an error just like linenum above because the program uses gc_count= gc_count+1. Therefore, gc_count must be defined before that line just like linenum needed to be defined before it updated itself.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.568993851852

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:

The Sum Count differs from the seq and Total Count in every file except the test-small.fastq file.

The Sum Count must be used as the denominator for computing the GC content and AT content because the Sum Count counts the total number of A's, T's, G's, and C's. The seq and Total Count seem to count some other thing in the files (they could be counting a blank space, some error, anything sort of data that was within the lines of the file).

My program incorrectly computed the AT/GC content because in homework3 the already coded program divided GC count by Total count (due to not having Sum Count yet).

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content

Collaboration:

None

Reflection:

I learned a great deal about debugging. I had no clue that the GC content calculated in Homework3 was intented to not work in Homework4. So, I spent a great deal of time wonder why the AT/GC contents were wrong before I realized that the wrong variable was being used in the denominator.
