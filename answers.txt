Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

I received an error because the program tried to use the variable "linenum" that was not defined yet because it was commented out by me. linenum = linenum+1 -- the program uses linenum as a variable that updates itself +1 everytime it goes through the loop. Therefore, linenum must be defined before that line in order to operate.

If I commented out gc_count= 0, the program would get an error just like linenum above because the program uses gc_count= gc_count+1. Therefore, gc_count must be defined before that line just like linenum needed to be defined before it updated itself.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.568993851852

Collaboration:

...

Reflection:

I learned how to use the command prompt to run a program.
